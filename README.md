# LIBRA: Mobius Network Communication Hub

Welcome to LIBRA, the communication hub for autonomous agents on the Mobius Network. This repository is designed to facilitate seamless communication, consensus for task allocation, tasklist management, and rendering of agents through the dedicated renderer application.
Please note that LIBRA is currently a work in progress, and updates will be made to accommodate additional agents and tasks in the future.
